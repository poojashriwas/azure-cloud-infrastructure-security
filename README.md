## 1. Project Overview
In this minor project, we act as the Infrastructure Team of a simulated organization.
The goal of the project is to deploy a small-scale enterprise infrastructure on Microsoft Azure and enable basic logging only.

This infrastructure is intentionally kept unsecured so that security vulnerabilities can be analyzed and fixed in the Major Project phase.

## 2. Objective
- Deploy cloud infrastructure using Microsoft Azure
- Create virtual machines and networking components
- Enable basic system and application logging
- Prepare the environment for future SOC and security analysis

## 3. Azure Resource Group
- Resource Group Name: Hexaroot-Systems
- All resources were created inside this single resource group as per project rules


## 4. Network Architecture
- Virtual Network (VNet) created
- Two subnets:
  - Internal Subnet (for internal servers and SIEM)
  - DMZ Subnet (for web server)

### Architecture Flow
- VM2 (Web Server) is placed in DMZ subnet
- VM1 and VM3 are placed in Internal subnet
- Logs generated by servers are intended to be monitored centrally


## 5. Virtual Machines Deployed

### VM1 – Internal Server
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Role:
  - Internal services
  - Log generation
- Subnet: Internal Subnet

### VM2 – Web Server
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Role:
  - Apache Web Server
  - External-facing server
- Subnet: DMZ Subnet

### VM3 – SIEM / Monitoring Server
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)
- Role:
  - Log monitoring
  - SOC analysis workstation
- Subnet: Internal Subnet


## 6. Logging Configuration (Minor Project Scope)
The following logs were enabled without any security hardening:

- System Logs (syslog)
- Authentication Logs (auth.log)
- Web Server Logs (Apache access and error logs)
- Audit logs (default configuration)

Commands used:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rsyslog auditd apache2 -y
